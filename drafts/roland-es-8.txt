## notes on roland es-8

the roland es-8 is an effects switching system. it lets you store and recall up to 800 different combinations of them. it provides dedicated jacks for connecting stereo-in/out effect units and volume pedals. it also provides a wide variety of external control functions for controlling your amp and effects in real time.

it has a midi in jack and a midi out/thru jack. you can connect an external midi device here to transmit and receive midi messages. the operation of the midi out/thru connectors depends on the system settings.

on the top panel:

* edit button: press this to make patch settinngs or system settings.  
* write button: press this to save patch settings.  
* - + buttons: use these to edit the value of a setting. hold down one button while pressing the other button to make the value change rapidly.  
* display/exit button: press this to switch the play screen, to cancel an operation or to return to the previous screen.
* enter button: press this to confirm an operation.  
* < > buttons: use these to move the cursos or to select a category or parameter.

lock function: when you press the display/exit button and enter button simultaneously to activate lock the lock function, all buttons will be disabled. this prevents settings from being changed when you inadvertently pess a button. the lock function turns off when you press both buttons simultaneously again.

effect loop: a connection in which an effect device is connected via send and return jacks. the es-9 provides eight different loops, 1-8.

there are two main modes:  

* memory mode: you can select patches, where each patch is a combination of effect loops and various settings.
* manual mode: you can turn the effect loops (!-8) on/off individually.

switches:  

* memory/manual switch: switches between memory mode (blue light) and manual mode (red light). hold down the switch section to enter memory edit mode.  
* bank down / bank up: to switch banks in memory mode.
* mute switch: mutes the sound that is output from the es-8. if mute is on, the light is blue. hold down for two seconds or more to enter the bypass state (red light)< the input is output without change.
* numbers switch 1-8:  use these to select a  patch number. the indicator of the current selected number is lit blue. in manual mode, these switches each turn each effect loop (1-8) on/off individually. when an effect loop is on, its number indicator is lit red.
* memo: you can assign a different function to each switch.

play screen: it is the screen that appears when you turn on the power. the state in which the play screen is shown is called the play mode. there are five types of play screen, and you can use the display/exit button to switch between them:  
* patch name screen
* loop on/off screen
* loop structure screen
* ctl out screen
* exp out screen
memo: even in play mode you can use the < > buttons and - + buttons to edit the settings.

the es-8 uses an analog switch array that lets you freely change the connection order of your effect units. it also contains two internal mixers, and lets you create a wide range of sounds by connecting effect units in parallel or using the carry over function.

carry over: this function cuts only the input while leaving the output connected whenn you change patches. for example, you can use this to allow just the delay sound to remain when switching patches.

## tips for creating patches (sounds)

the es-8 has two internal mixers. using them is important in order to take advantage of the es-8's unique features, such as the ability to connect loops in parallel and use the carry over function. understandingn how to use them will make it even more enjoyable to create patches (sounds).

note: the same mixers are used for parallel connections and for carry over. this means that depending on the settings, you might not be able to use a parallel connection, or that carry over might not work.

### parallel connection
* if the effect units are mono, you can make parallel connections in two places simultaneously.  
* if the effect units are stereo, one parallel connection uses both of the two mixers.  

### using the carry over function
*  this lets you preserve the sound (e.g. delay sound) when you switch patches. after the patch change the send to the delay loop is cut, and only the return is mixed with the direct sound.
* to use the carry over function, enable carry over for the patch that follows the patch change.
* carry over might not work if the loop structure settinngs differ before and after the patch change.

## changing the effect loop settings

in the loop structure screen you can make the following settings:
* chane the connection order of the effect loops
* create a parallel connection
* specify carry over

the loop structure screenn shows the following content:

|sign            |description|
|----------------|--------------------|
|i               |in                  |
|v               |volume loop         |
|1-8             |loop number         |
|black background|loop with carry over|
|-               |mon                 |
|=               |stereo              |
|o               |out                 |

the screen is not able to show all the content simultaneously. you can see the remaining content by using the < > buttons to move the cursor.  

### changing the effect loop connection order

in play mode, press the display/exit button several times to access the loop structure screen.

use the < > buttons to select the loop whose connection you wannt to change.

use the - + buttonsn to move the loop number.

### changing the connection order of the volume loop

you can change the connection order of the volume pedal (v) in the same way as for the effect loop.

### specifying mono/stereo return for effect loops 7 and 8

for the return of effect loops 7 and 8, set the system setting preference to select mono-return or stereo-return.

### making a parallel connection

use the < > buttons to move the cursor to the merge point of the parallel connection, and press the enter button.

depending on the settings, there might be cases in which parallel connections is not possible.

use the > button to select the loop whose connection you want to change.

use the - button to move the loop number.

### cancelling a parallel connections

use the < > buttons to move the cursor to the merge point of the parallel connection, and press the enter button< the parallel connection is canceled.

### specifying carry over

use the < > buttons to select the loop for which you want to specify carry over, and press the enter button.

depending on the settings, there are cases in which carry over does not work.  

## editing the settings of a patch (memory edit mode)

### quick edit

here is how you can turn the effect loops on/off and save the settings by operating only the switches.

* recall the patch that you want to edit.
* hold down the memory/manual switch for two seconds or longer. the memory/manual indicator blinks blue; the es-8 is in memory edit mode.
* use number switches 1-8 to turn each effect loop on/off.
* press the memory manual switch.
* use the bank up / bank down switches and number switches 1-8 to select the save destination.
* press the memory manual switch. if you decide to cancel, press the mute switch. when the settings are saved, the memory/manual indicator changes to steadily lit blue.

## basic operation

* recall the patch that you want to edit.
* press the edit button
* use the < > buttons to select patch or ctrl/exp, and press the enter button.
* use the < > buttons to select a category, and press the enter button.  
* use the < > buttons to move the cursor, and use the - + buttons to specify its value.
* to save the edited settings, write the patch. to cancel without saving, press the display/exit button several times.

### parameter list

* patch name: up to 16 characters.
* loop on/off: you can turn each effect loop on/off. when on, a black square icon is shown. you can also turn them on/off by pressing the number switches 1-8.
* loop structure carry over: you can make the following settinngs. for details on operation, refer to "changing the effect loop settings": connection order of each effect loop, parallel connection settings, connection position of volume loop, carry over setting. depending on the settings, there are cases in which parallel connection is not possible, or in which carry over does not work.
* ctl 1-6: specify the control signals that are sent from the ext ctl ctl 1/2-5/6 jacks when you switch patches. the available control signals depend on the play option/ctl1-6 setting.  

|for lat:|         |
|--------|---------|
|off     |sends off|
|on      |sends on |

for pls: off, on, ends a short (100ms) pulse when changing between off/on. if the state display of the es-8 differs from the state of the connected equipment, switch the state of the connected equipment.

|for tp2-4:|             |
|----------|-------------|
|off       |sends nothing|
|notes     |sends tempo at the interval specified note value according to the master bpm value, depending on the master bpm setting there are cases in which this cannot be sent.|
|20-500    |sends the specified tempo|

* exp1,2: specify the control signals that are sent from the ext ctl exp1-2 jacks when you switch patches. 0-127: the specified value is sent. exp1, 2: the current value of the expression pedal connected to the ctl in jack is sent.

* input sel: selects the input. 1: in 1 jack is selected. 2: in 2 jack is selected.

* input buf: turns the input buffer on/off.

* output sel: selects the output destination. 1,2: the sound is output from the out 1/l or out 2/r jack. 1&2: the sound is output from both the out 1/l and out 2/r jacks (stereo output).

* output buf: turns the output buffer on/off.

* output gain: this is the output gain, it is used only if output buf is on. 0 db, +2 db, +4 db, +6 db.

* master bpm: specifies the patch's bpm. 20-500.  

patch midi 1-8  

* ch: specifies the transmit channel for midi messages.

* lsb msb: specifies whether bank select messages are transmitted when you switch patches. it is not possible to turn on only bank lsb. not transmitted if pc is off. it is not possible to transmit only bank select. bank select is always transmitted in conjunction with program change. off: not transmitted. 0-127: the specified value is transmitted.

* pc: specifies whether a program change is transmitted when you switch patches. off: not transmitted. 1-128: the specified value is transmitted.

* ctl1-2 cc#: specifies whether a control change is transmitted when you switch patches. off: not transmitted. cc#000-127: the specified control change is transmitted.

* ctl1-2 val: specifies the value of the control change. 0-127.

ctl-exp

## making global settings (system setting)

settings that are shared by the entire es-8 are called system settings.

* press the edit button.

* use the < > buttons to select the system setting category (play option-others), and then press the enter button.

* use the < > buttons to select a parameter, and then press the enter button.

* use the - + buttons to specify the value.  

* press the display/exit button several times to return to the play screen.

### list of parameters

category: midi setting

* midi out mode: selects the operation of the midi out/thru connector. out: operates as a midi out connector. thru: operates as a midi thru connector. midi data received at midi in is mixed with the midi data of the es-8, and output together.

* rxch: specifies the midi channel on which midi messages are received. 1-16.

* dev id: specifies the device id used to transmit and receive exclusive messages. 1-32.

* sync: this setting determines the basis used for synchronizing the timing for tempo and other time-based parameters. when synchronizing performances to the midi clock signal from an external midi device, timing problems in the performance may occur due to errors in the midi clock. int: synchronize with the es-8's internal clock. auto: synchronize with midi clock received via midi. however, automatically synchronize with the es-8's internal clock if midi clock messages cannot be received.

* clock out: specifies wheter midi clock messages are transmitted. on, off.

## patch/data operations (utility)

* press the edit button

* use the < > buttons to select utility, and press the enter button.

* use the < > buttons to select the desired item, and press the enter button.

### transmitting data to an external midi device (bulk dump)

with the es-8 you can use exclusive messages to set another es-8 to the same settings or to save settins to midi sequencers and other such devices. this transmission of data is referred to as bulk dump. both system settings and settings of the selected patch can be transmitted.

* when transmitting data to another es-8: make connections and set the transmitting and receiving units to the same device id.

* when saving to a midi sequencer: make connections, and put the sequencer in the state where it is ready to receive exclusive messages.

specify the highest patch whose data you want to transmit, and press the enter button. when the confirmation message appears, press the enter button once again.

* restoring saved data from a midi sequencer to the es-8: connect your midi sequencer's midi out to the es-8's midi in, select the same device id as when transmitting the data to the midi sequencer, and then transmit the data from the midi sequencer.

### restoring the factory settings (factory reset)

both system settings and settings of the selected patch can be be returned to their factory-set condition (factory reset). all data that is reset is lost.

specify the highest patch that you want to reset, and press the enter button. when the confirmation message appears, press the enter button again.

## error messages

* midi buffer full!: the data cannot be processed correctly due to the high volume of midi messages.

* midi offline!: tranmissions from the connected device have been interrupted. this message also appears when the power to the connected device has been turned off. it does not indicate damage.
