### getting started

the up/down arrow buttons (to the right of the 0 and 5 number buttons) increase or decrease values respectively. press only one button at a time.

the display has several "windows" that inform you of the sr-16's status. if the instructions mention that a particular word should or should not show up in a particular window, check the window to see which is the case before proceeding.  

there are three mode buttons that select basic operational modes. these buttons toggle between the two options (press for one option, press again for the other option).

* preset/user: this selects between two banks of drum sets and rhythm patterns. preset drum sets and rhythm patterns are permanently etched into the sr-16's little silicon brain and cannot be altered. user drum sets and rhythm patterns can be programmed, erased, and otherwise edited by the user.

* pattern/song: in pattern mode, you can play back (and with user patterns, record) individual rhythm patterns. these are usually fairly short—say, 4 to 16 beats—and form the basic elements of a song. in song mode you create a "playlist", which plays various patterns in the desired order.

* perform/compose: in the case of either pattern or song mode, perform mode is designed for playback, and compose for recording.

if you are stuck in a situation and you don't know how to get out of it, press the stop button.

### check out some patterns:

* press the pattern/song button to select pattern mode.
* press the preset/user button to select preset patterns.
* press the up/down buttons to select a pattern. you can also enter 00-49.
* press play to start a pattern, press stop to stop it. when a pattern reaches its end, it will loop back to its beginning and play again unless you stop it or choose another pattern.
* change the tempo by pressign the tempo/up and tempo/down arrow buttons.

### playing sequences of patterns:

each pattern number, preset and user, includes a and b sub-patterns.

* begin by selecting a pattern and pressing play. the upper right window shows the selected pattern number and whether the a or b variation is selected. the display's upper left line normally counts each beat of the selected pattern as it plays.
* if an a pattern is playing, press the b button (or viceversa). the alternate pattern will begin playing as soon as the currently selected pattern reaches its end. until that happens, the display will show the name of the pattern you selected. after an alternate pattern kicks in, the display's upper right window will show the pattern number and whether it is the a or b variation.
* experiment with switching between the a adn b variations. listen to how the patterns sound, and observe how the display keeps you informed of what's happening.
* you can call up a different pattern number if desired. press the up/down arrow buttonsn to select a pattern or enter a number 00-49.
* the new pattern will play the same variation (a or b) as what's already selected. to choose a different variation, press a or b before the current pattern has finished playing.

### fun with fills

each a and b variation also includes associated fill patterns, which can play expressive transitions between a and b variations. you can push a button to have a fill take over from its associated main pattern adn transition to the alternate pattern.

* begin by selecting an a pattern then pressing play.
* press and release the fill button while the main a pattern is playing, preferably somewhere around beat 4 or so. you will hear a tasty drum fill tjat leads right into the associated b pattern.
* press the fill button again. a different fill will transition from the b pattern back into the a pattern.
* fills do not always have to be transitional patterns. suppose an a pattern is playing. if you press the fill button, a fill will start—but this time, keep the fill button held down until after the fill has finished playing. this cancels the transition to the alternate pattern (in this example, the a pattern would continue playing).

### create and erase a song

the sr-16 can remember the order in which you selected patterns, which variations were selected, and when you selected fills. recording this information in the sr-16's song mode creates a complete song. begin with the sr-16 stopped.

* select song mode.
* the display on the upper left should say empty song. if not, press the up or down buttons until an empty song is selected.
* press the perform/compose button so select compose. the display will show step 01 and the contents of the step, which is currently end (to indicate that the song is empty).
* choose a pattern for song step 1 by entering a pattern number and a or b variation. this step can be a fill if you press fill along with a or b.  user patterns should not be selected for now. if user appears next to the pattern number you entered in the upper left window, press preset/user to select presets.
* press play. the pattern specified above will start playing.
* choose patterns, a and b variations, and fills. each selection will be remembered as another song step, and the sr-16 will also remember the exact instant you selected a fill. if you don't specify a new pattern, every time a pattern repeats it will add a new song step.
* when you have finished creating the song, press stop.
* to hear your song, press perform/compose to select perform mode, then press play.
* if you like the song, great! the sr-16 will remember it. entering the song number in song and perform mode will call up the song.
* to erase the song, you must have the song selected. the sr-16 should be stopped and in perform mode. press erase and while holding it down, press play. the song will be erased.

### footswitch control

you can use both normally open and normally closed footswitches. always plug them before turning on power.

#### set tempo

the sr-16 must be stopped. before playing a song or pattern, tap the count/a/b/fill jack footswitch several times at the desired tempo. the sr-16 will average the time between taps and derive a tempo, the display will update the tempo with each tap. tapping the stop button accomplishes the same result as tappign the count/a/b/fill footswitch.

#### start a song or pattern

when the sr-16 is stopped, pressing the start/stop footswitch is equivalent to pressing play. when it is running, it is equivalent to pressing stop.

#### initiate a fill when playing patterns

in perform mode, the count/a/b/fill footswitch duplicates the fill button function when playing patterns.

#### cancel a transition from a to b, or b to a, patterns

when you initiate a fill, an a pattern will transition to a b pattern (or vice-versa) when the fill has finished playing. however, you can cancel this transition if desired. we have already explained how to do this with the front panel fill button. however, you can also use the count/a/b/fill footswitch. if you press the footswitch before the fill has finished playing and hold it down until after the fill has played, the sr-16 will return to the original main a or b pattern.

#### extend a song step when playing back a song

in song perform mode, pressing and holding the count/a/b/fill footswitch until past the end of a song step will cause that step to repeat. this is great if the soloist wants to take a few more bars.

### record a pattern

the sr-16 offers very flexible and musical recording options.

* press the pattern/song button to select pattern mode.
* press the preset/user button to select user patterns. unlike preset patterns, you can record into and edit user patterns.
* push the perform/compose button until the display's lower middle shows compose.
* press the up/down arrow buttons until you find an empty pattern. you can also enter a pattern number 00-49, and/or select an a or b pattern.
* press play to start recording. you will probably hear a metronome click. when a pattern reaches its end, it will loop back to the beginning so you can do overdubs.
* play the pads. the sr-16 will shift your playing to the nearest rhytmic value shown in the lower-left corner of the quantize window. refer to the main manual for information on changing quantization.
* if you make a mistake, press and hold down the erase button. if you press a pad while holding down erase, any notes played by that pad that occur between the time you press and release the pad, will be erased.
* don't forget that you can play difficult passages by slowing down the tempo, playing the part, then speeding back up again.

### create a drum set

this is an example of a function with multiple pages. the sr-16 has 50 preset and 50 editable user drum sets (groups of sounds) which can be assigned to any of the 100 patterns. after pressing the drum set button, each press of the tempo/page up button selects a different kind of parameter (drum sound, tuning, volume, etc.) tap the pad to be edited, then enter the new parameter value with the up/down, arrow or number buttons. to edit more pads, tap another pad and enter a new value. after editing the pads, press the tempo/page up buttonn to acess the next type of parameter. the sr-16 should be stopped.

* press drum set. select a number from 00-49 with the number buttons and preset or user with the preset/user button. preset drum sets can only be saved to user locations.
* press the tempo/page up button to choose page 2, where you can assign different drum sounds to different pads. press the pad to be assigned then use the up/down or number buttons to select one of the available sounds.
* in a manner similar to step 2, press the tempo/page up button to choose page 3, where you can assign different levels for each pad. tap a pad, then use the up/down or number buttons to select the level.
* in a manner similar to step 4, press the tempo/page up button to choose page 5, where you can assign the tuning for each pad. tap a pad, then use the up/down or number buttons to select the tuning.
* to save the new drum set parameters, press the tempo/page up button three times to choose page 8, where you can save the drum set parameters you have selected. if you had selected a preset drum set, your changes will be saves in the like-numbered user drum set (or enter a different number). press play to save, or drum set to back out.
* if you pressed play, press drum set to return to normal operation.

### use the sr-16 as an expander module

those with electronic drum pads or a sequencer can use the sr-16 as a tone module, where different drums will sound in response to different midi notes received at the sr-16's midi in. you must run a midi cable from the sequencer or electronic drum set's midi out to the sr-16's midi in.

the sr-16 has a special "expander module" mode that assigns a specific midi note to each pad of a set of 10 user drum sets. the chart in section 6.9 of the reference manual shows which midi note triggers which pad of which drum set. assign sounds to each pad of these drum sets as described previously. the sr-16 should be stopped.


* press midi setup. use the up/down buttons to select omni mode or a specific midi channel or poly mode.
* press the tempo/page up button to choose page 2. press the up arrow button so that drum in is on, which allows the sr-16 to receive midi note data.
* press the tempo/page up button three times to choose page 5. press the down arrow button so that the clock in is off, which means the sr-16 ignores midi synchronization data.
* press the tempo/page up button three times to choose page 8. press the down arrow buttonn so that the prg chng is off, which means the sr-16 ignores midi program change data.
* press the tempo/page up button to choose page 9. press the up arrow button so that the note map shows d00-09, d10-19, etc.
* the sr-16 is onw set up as an expander module. press midi setup again to exit midi setup mode and return to normal operation.
